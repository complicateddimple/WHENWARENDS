/**
 * The NEWS_API_KEY and NEWS_API_URL have been removed.
 * Direct client-side calls to the NewsAPI are not allowed on their developer plan
 * when a site is deployed to a service like Netlify (it only works on localhost).
 * To resolve this, the application has been modified to rely on the Gemini model's
 * internal knowledge for its analysis, removing the dependency on real-time news fetching.
